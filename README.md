<h2>choices that I made</h2>
<p>when i started with this project i did not expect that i can make a form where the user can login and where data is stored so i will tel you what my stratagy is to make this application</p>

here you can see the steps what i followed to make this page and there is a `plan-making-react-assingment` where you can see how i am going to start with this project.
the ol list that you see here is how i tackled this project with multiple steps and explanations

<ol>
  <li>I started with installing react</li>
  <li>I added some text in the home page and figure out how to navigate between the pages</li>
   <li>I made the nav</li>
  <li>i make the form and try to store some data with localstorage so that i can see it back in the inspector and console log helps me alot with showing what the code does</p>
  <li>for this i followed a lot of tutorials and use google for understanding what this code does in the code there are a lot of links to find and comments about the code</li> 
  <li>I figured out that this is condital rendering with a login state and a state where the user needs to login</li>
  <li>after i figured out how to store data the next step was to check if the user was already logged in and that was the most difficult part because you need to check the data in the localstorage and you need to change in the main the form or the text `you are logged in` with a if statemeent</li>
  <li>with UseEffects it is going to check if the data is already there in the localstorage and if not show the form and a boolean true or false is not working because there must be data checked</li>
  <li>with Usenaviagion you can navigato to the dashboard an i have almost the same with code there because you do the same as in the login page witht he difference that there is no form to show to the user</li>
  <li>i made a animation for the nav</li>
  <li>I did a performance and accesbility test</li>
</ol>
